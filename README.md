1. Click on the icon of the iFetch Chrome Extension, which will open a chat window.

## Editing

If you wish to extend or customize the current version of the project or use it as an interface for your own project, please follow these instructions.

### Change Endpoint

The first step is to change the endpoint used by the project. To do this, you need to modify the `MESSAGES_ENDPOINT` field in both the "App.js" and "Content.js" files. Update the endpoint to the URL of the desired server.

### Send Messages

To send a message with your content, you need to receive messages in the following JSON format:

```yaml
{
  utterance : utterance,
  user_id : userId, 
  session_id: sessionId,
  user_action: userAction,
  interface_selected_product_id: selectedId,
  image: image
}
```

The `utterance` field contains the message to be sent, the `user_id` field contains the unique identifier for the user, the `session_id` field contains the unique identifier for the session, the `user_action` field contains the action taken by the user, and the `interface_selected_product_id` field contains the identifier of the selected product. After making this changes you have to build the project using `npm` or `yarn`, and running the command `yarn run build`.
