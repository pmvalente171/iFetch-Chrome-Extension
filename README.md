1. Click on the icon of the iFetch Chrome Extension, which will open a chat window.

## Editing

If you wish to extend or customize the current version of the project or use it as an interface for your own project, please follow these instructions.

### Change Endpoint

The first step is to change the endpoint used by the project. To do this, you need to modify the `MESSAGES_ENDPOINT` field in both the "App.js" and "Content.js" files. Update the endpoint to the URL of the desired server.

### Send Messages

The messages are sent to the backend with the following JSON format:

```yaml
{
  utterance : string,
  user_id : string, 
  session_id : string,
  user_action : string,
  interface_selected_product_id: string,
  image: base64 byte dump
}
```

The `utterance` field contains the message to be sent, the `user_id` field contains the unique identifier for the user, the `session_id` field contains the unique identifier for the session, the `user_action` field contains the action taken by the user, and the `interface_selected_product_id` field contains the identifier of the selected product. After making this changes you have to build the project using `npm` or `yarn`, and running the command `yarn run build`.

The interface expects responses in the following JSON format:

```yaml
{
  has_response : bool,
  recommendations : List<Recommendations>,
  response : string,
  system_action : string
}
```
Where recommendations are presented in the following JSON format:

```yaml
{
  brand : string,
  description : string,
  id : int,
  image_path : string
}
```
